# 1. Purpose

This document describes the UbuntuConnect ecosystem from a high-level perspective.

It defines:

- External actors
- Internal systems
- System boundaries
- Data flow
- Communication between components

This document provides architectural context before implementation begins.

# 2. System Overview

UbuntuConnect is a three-tier web application that enables collaboration between Individuals, Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs), Businesses, and Platform Administrators.

The system follows a client-server architecture.

# 11. Security Boundary

Every request requiring protected resources must:

Authenticate

AI Recommendation Engine

Analytics

Reporting

Without requiring architectural redesign.

# 14. Architectural Principles

UbuntuConnect follows:

Client-Server Architecture

RESTful APIs

Separation of Concerns

Layered Architecture

Dependency Injection

Stateless APIs

Component-Based Frontend

Centralized State Management

Reusable UI Components

# 15. AI Responsibilities

Before implementing any feature the AI must identify:

Which actors use the feature

Which frontend components are involved

Which API endpoints are required

Which DTOs are exchanged

Which database entities are affected

Which authentication rules apply

Which validations are required

Which business rules govern the feature

Implementation must only begin after this analysis is complete.
