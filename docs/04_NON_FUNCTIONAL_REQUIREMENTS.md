# UbuntuConnect Non-Functional Requirements Specification (NFRS)

Version: 1.0

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the quality attributes that UbuntuConnect must satisfy.

Unlike Functional Requirements, which define what the system does, Non-Functional Requirements define how well the system performs.

Every implementation must satisfy these requirements.

# 2. Scope

These requirements apply to:

- Frontend
- Backend
- Database
- APIs
- Authentication
- Deployment
- Documentation

NFR-002

API requests should provide loading indicators while awaiting responses.

NFR-003
