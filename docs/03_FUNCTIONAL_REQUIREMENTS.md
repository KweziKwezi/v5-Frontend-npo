# UbuntuConnect Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)

Version: 1.0

---

> **Note on authority:** This document describes original design intent for UbuntuConnect. For actual implementation status of any requirement, verify against `api-contract.md` and `database.md` (generated from the real backend) — where this document and the code disagree, the code is the source of truth.

## Implementation Status Legend

- [BUILT] — endpoint exists, has been manually tested end-to-end, working as documented
- [BUILT-UNTESTED] — endpoint exists in code, has NOT been run/verified yet — treat with caution, verify behavior before building frontend against it
- [NEEDS-FIX] — known issue exists, do not copy this pattern elsewhere until fixed
- [PLANNED] — no backend code exists — do not invent

This project is NOT feature-complete. Significant portions of the backend
(Campaigns, Reports, Admin, Feed) have not been tested. Do not assume
"exists in code" means "verified correct." When in doubt, ask before
building frontend against an untested endpoint, or flag it for testing first.

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines every functional capability that UbuntuConnect must provide.

A functional requirement describes **what the system must do**.

Every frontend component, backend API, database entity and business process must satisfy one or more functional requirements defined in this document.

If a feature cannot be traced back to a functional requirement, it should not be implemented without approval.

---

# 2. Scope

The functional requirements cover the complete UbuntuConnect platform, including:

- Authentication
- User Management
- Profile Management
- Campaign Management
- Posts
- Community Engagement
- Volunteering
- Donations
- Partnerships
- Notifications
- Search
- Administration

# 9. Donations

## FR-020 Donate

Users shall donate to an NPO by transferring funds from their own platform wallet to the NPO's platform wallet.

This is implemented as an internal wallet-to-wallet balance transfer, processed as an atomic database transaction (all-or-nothing). It does not depend on, or integrate with, any external payment gateway. Insufficient balance is rejected, and the failed attempt is still logged for audit purposes, consistent with real-world financial record-keeping practice.

# 15. Traceability

Every implemented feature must be traceable to one or more Functional Requirement IDs.

Example:

A100

↓

Register Page

↓

POST /register

↓

Register DTO

↓

User Entity

↓

Database


Success Response

# 16. AI Responsibilities

Before implementing any feature, the AI must:

1. Identify the Functional Requirement ID.

2. Locate the corresponding backend API.

3. Identify required DTOs.

4. Verify business rules.

5. Confirm authorization.

6. Map frontend components.

7. Produce an implementation plan.

Only after this analysis may implementation begin.
